# byte

A work-in-progress fantasy console designed to provide a user-friendly platform for those who want to learn 6502 assembly.

# Progress

- [x] core emulation of 6502, passes [Klaus' test suite](https://github.com/Klaus2m5/6502_65C02_functional_tests)
- [ ] functional emulator
- [ ] custom assembler
- [ ] custom programming language

There is a simple PoC deployed at [brkp.github.io/byte](https://brkp.github.io/byte), running [static.s](byte_emu/assets/static.s). I intend to focus the development efforts on creating the assembler before working on the emulator part of the project.
